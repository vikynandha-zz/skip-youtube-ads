Skip youtube preroll (video) ads
=============================

## What is this?

This is a small chrome extension I wrote to be merged with the extension Adzap (http://www.getadzap.com).

## How to install?

I haven't yet packaged this to be available in Google webstore. Anyway, you can install this by doing the following steps:
1. Get the code
   * Download this as zip and extract to any place in your computer (or)
   * Clone the repo
2. Open your Google Chrome / Chromium web browser
3. From _Tools_ menu click _Extensions_
4. In the _Extenions_ window, check the _Developer mode_ checkbox. You should now see a new row of buttons.
5. Click `Load unpacked extension`
6. Select the folder into which you extracted/cloned the code
7. Done. Now go to youtube. You should see a `Skip ad` button in the row of buttons above the video.
8. Enjoy watching videos without ads :)
