Skip youtube preroll (video) ads
=============================

## What is this?

This is a small chrome extension I wrote to be merged with the extension Adzap (http://www.getadzap.com).

## How to install?

I haven't yet packaged this to be available in Google webstore. Anyway, you can install this by doing the following steps:

1. Get the code
   * [Download this as zip](https://github.com/vikynandha/skip-youtube-ads/zipball/master) and extract to any place in your computer [OR]
   * Clone the repo
2. Open your Google Chrome / Chromium web browser
3. From `Tools` menu click `Extensions`
4. In the `Extenions` window, check the `Developer mode` checkbox. You should now see a new row of buttons.
5. Click `Load unpacked extension`
6. Select the folder into which you extracted/cloned the code
7. Done. Now go to youtube. You should never see an ad again.
   *  In case you see an ad (I'm not a genius), just click the `Skip ad` button at the bottom-left corner of your browser.
9. Enjoy watching videos without ads :)
